In this workshop, you will practice working with the aria-live and aria-label attributes by building an accessible note taking app.

:contenteditable
To make that div element editable, you can use the contenteditable attribute like this:
Example Code <div contenteditable="true"></div>

:aria-live
aria-live attribute which is used to create a live region on a page. This will allow screen reader users to be automatically notified when the content of the live region changes, without needing to manually focus on or interact with it.

:polite
The polite value will tell screen readers to wait until any current announcement is finished or until the user stops typing before announcing the update.

:blur event
blur event. This event fires when an element loses focus. Here is an example:
Example Code
element.addEventListener("blur", () => {
// do something here
});

:focus
The desired behavior is for the message to disappear when the user focuses on the element. You can use the focus event for this.
