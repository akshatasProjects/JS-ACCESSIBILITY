* transitionend 

The transitionend event in JavaScript is used to detect when a 
CSS transition on an element has completed. You can attach an 
event listener for this event using the addEventListener() method.

PROJECT : Planet TabList

aria-labelledby:
The aria-labelledby attribute is needed here to associate the tablist with a visible label, helping assistive technologies like screen readers announce the purpose of the tablist to users.

aria-controls:
There needs to be a way to connect the buttons to the content they represent. This is done by using the aria-controls attribute on each button.

aria-selected
When a user selects a tab, the aria-selected attribute should be updated to "true" for that tab and "false" for all others. This indicates which tab is currently active and ensures accessibility for assistive technologies.


[role="tab"] is an attribute selector that targets elements where the role attribute equals "tab".
The result is a NodeList, which behaves like an array.
